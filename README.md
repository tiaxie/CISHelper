# CISHelper
This App includes features to help out computer science students at Penn. We chose and designed the features based on surverys we conducted. We want to help CS students at Penn tackle homeworks and learn faster. 
For example, one feature is to convert between binary, decimal, and hexidecimal conveniently and do calculations in different bases. This feature helps Penn students finish CIS 240 HW 150% faster!

We interviewed a few students and send out surverys to CIS students @ Penn when designing this product. We uploaded four interviews, and will update the survey analysis soon

The MVP Demo videos are also in the github and are named "MVP_demo_part_1" and "MVP_demo_part_2".
